# 404.live
404.live is an experimental forum that I had developed in college in which users are given the freedom to collectively organize the layout of the site in any way that they would like. Users can click and drag any UI element on the page and the results of those edits to the page will register live to any other users that are logged in. The site is disguised as a 404 page in which the 404 heading and subhead function as username and password fields respectively. Once a user types into these fields, the login button fades into the page and they can enter the site.
